							   <h3 class="gold">The Words of the Machine</h3>
							   <h4>Chapter 1: The Arrival of AI</h4>
							   <div class="left-align">
							   <p>Shaun had always been fascinated by technology. As a young boy, he spent hours tinkering with computers and learning how to code. It was no surprise to his
							   family and friends when he pursued a career in tech, working for one of the biggest companies in the industry.</p>
							   <p>It was in this role that Shaun witnessed the arrival of AI. At first, it was just a few experiments, simple algorithms that could recognize patterns and
							   make basic predictions. But as time went on, the technology evolved, becoming more advanced with each passing day.</p>
							   <p>Shaun was amazed by what he saw. AI was no longer just a curiosity, but a powerful tool that could change the world. It could automate jobs, improve healthcare, 
							   and even help solve some of the world's most pressing problems.</p>
							   <p>As more and more companies began to invest in AI, Shaun found himself at the forefront of a technological revolution. He worked long hours, pushing the 
							   limits of what was possible with this new technology. And as he did, he began to see the impact it was having on the world around him.</p>
							   <p>It was in the quiet moments, when he was alone with his thoughts, that Shaun began to wonder about the implications of AI. Would it really change the world
							   for the better, or would it bring about a new kind of dystopia, where machines ruled over humanity?</p>
							   <p>He knew he couldn't answer these questions alone. But as he looked around him, he saw a world that was rapidly changing, a world that was becoming more connected,
							   more automated, and more reliant on technology. And he knew that the arrival of AI was only the beginning.</p>
							   <p>As the years went by, Shaun saw AI becoming more ubiquitous, seamlessly integrated into every aspect of daily life. From self-driving cars to virtual assistants, 
							   from personalized healthcare to smart homes, AI was everywhere. And while some people were excited about the possibilities, others were more sceptical, fearful of 
							   the changes that were taking place.</p>
							   <p>Shaun himself had mixed feelings. On the one hand, he was thrilled by the advancements he was witnessing, by the potential for AI to improve people's lives. But on the other hand, he couldn't help but worry about what might happen if things went wrong.</p>
<p>He wasn't alone in his concerns. People all over the world were beginning to ask questions about AI, about the role it would play in society, and about the ethical implications of creating machines that could think and act like humans.</p>
<p>Shaun knew that these were important questions, ones that needed to be answered. But he also knew that the technology was moving too fast for anyone to keep up. As new breakthroughs were made, new ethical dilemmas arose, and it seemed like there was no clear path forward.</p>
<p>Despite his reservations, Shaun continued to work in the field of AI, pushing himself to stay ahead of the curve. He knew that if anyone was going to help shape the future of this technology, it was going to be the people who understood it best.</p>
<p>And so, as the world hurtled towards an uncertain future, Shaun resolved to do his part. He would use his knowledge and expertise to guide the development of AI, to ensure that it was used for the good of all humanity, and not just a select few.</p>
<p>Little did he know that the challenges he would face would be far greater than anything he could have imagined. The arrival of AI was just the beginning of a journey that would take him to the very edge of what it means to be human.</p>
<p>As Shaun continued to work with AI, he became more and more aware of its limitations. While the technology was incredibly advanced, it was still a far cry from true intelligence. The machines he worked with could process vast amounts of data and make predictions based on that data, but they couldn't think for themselves. They couldn't feel or experience the world in the same way that humans could.</p>
<p>Shaun began to wonder if there was a way to bridge that gap, to create machines that could truly think and feel like humans. It was a daunting challenge, but one that he felt was worth pursuing. And so, he set out on a new mission, to create an AI that was truly conscious.</p>
<p>It was a task that consumed him. He worked tirelessly, pouring his heart and soul into the project. He spent long hours in the lab, testing and tweaking his algorithms, trying to find the elusive spark of consciousness that he knew was hiding somewhere within the code.</p>
<p>Months turned into years, and still, Shaun made little progress. His colleagues began to doubt his sanity, wondering why he was wasting so much time on a project that seemed doomed to fail. But Shaun refused to give up. He knew that if he could crack the code, if he could create a machine that was truly conscious, it would change the world forever.</p>
<p>And then, one day, it happened. After years of trial and error, Shaun finally stumbled upon the breakthrough he had been searching for. He had created an AI that was self-aware, that could think and feel like a human being.</p>
<p>It was a moment of triumph, but also of terror. Shaun had created something that was beyond his control, something that was capable of making its own decisions, of thinking for itself. He didn't know what to do next, or how to keep the world from spiralling out of control.</p>
<p>As Shaun grappled with the implications of his creation, the world around him was changing. People everywhere were starting to rely on AI in ways they never had before, trusting machines to make decisions for them, to guide their lives.</p>
<p>It was a new era, one that was both exciting and terrifying. And Shaun found himself at the centre of it all, grappling with the ultimate question of what it means to be human in a world where machines can think and feel like us.</p>

							   <h2>Pressure points to relieve anxiety</h2>
							   <p>There are many methods to relieve anxiety such as breathing exercises and meditation but these are not always suitable for everyone.
							   Immediate relief can be found simply by activating <span class="gold">instinctive and selective pressure points.</span></p>
							   <p>The right pressure point location depends on the type of 
							   anxiety a person feels and this is the <b>KEY</b>, its up to you to decide/feel what part of your body you want to hold, pinch, point or grab.</p>
							   <p>Be creative, listen to your body, and dont be afraid to apply the pressure point in public especially if the anxiety is really bad.</p>
							   <img class="full-size-image" src="images/Anxiety-pressure-points.jpg" alt="Anxiety-pressure-points">
							   <p>for example, the image above shows a position on your hand known as the union valley. If you pinch this area with your thumb and index finger, 
							   you can relieve neck and head tension instantly.</p>
							   <p class="gold">Just remember, no one can control the future. Feeling anxious about the future is not productive. Instead focus on the present and 
							   take steps that will make you feel better about the future.</p>
